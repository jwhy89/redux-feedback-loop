# Redux Feedback Loop

The Redux Feedback Loop web application allows users to submit feedback through a multi-part form. After the user has navigated through the form and submitted their feedback, they are routed to a `Thank You Page` and are able to restart the feedback loop by clicking the `Leave New Feedback` button. There is also an admin page that can be viewed by navigating to `localhost:3000/#/admin`. The user is able to view a table of the feedback submitted and delete feedback submissions.
